        <p>
          NASHA Organization was founded in May 2024 by Dennis Munga Thuku with the vision of promoting mental health awareness and emotional well-being in Kenya. Based in Nyeri, NASHA was established in response to the growing mental health crisis among young people, families, and communities, especially in underserved regions.

The organization focuses on mental health advocacy, education, early intervention, and support services, offering community outreach programs, workshops, and counseling sessions. NASHA also partners with schools, religious institutions, and local governments to destigmatize mental illness and promote a culture of mental wellness.

Since its inception, NASHA has reached hundreds of individuals through its grassroots initiatives and remains committed to building a mentally healthy and resilient society.
