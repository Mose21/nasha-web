          <b>Samwel Memusi</b> is the Co-founder and Deputy Director of NASHA Organization. He is a native of Narok County and holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Meru University of Science and Technology. Samwel is deeply passionate about community development and youth empowerment, especially in bridging the gap between technology and mental health awareness.

Samwel and Dennis met as students at Meru University, where they became close friends through shared interests in leadership, mentorship, and community service. Their late-night conversations about the mental health struggles faced by students and youth in rural Kenya sparked the idea that later became NASHA Organization.

Samwel brings a unique tech-driven perspective to NASHA’s mission, helping the organization build digital platforms, awareness campaigns, and data-driven outreach programs. His leadership style is grounded in empathy, innovation, and a strong belief in the power of collaboration to spark change.
